  Describing our skills and writting information about ourselves and SuperDevelopers team.
  Creating a form to easily contact us.

:star2: **HOw**
Our journey was a short one, in two days we successed to bulid a project that meets  
  meets requirements. It was interesting and full of challenges and big challenge for us was
  using the TERMINAL in the right way.
  We learned alot of new things like submitting a form, to work in team, push pull and merge
  and the very improtant thing that we have learned is "NERER EVER PUSH TO MASTER".

  :star2: If we have a time to complete the project we will work more on the design,
    to apply the media query and make it work,
    to add more pictures and style things.
